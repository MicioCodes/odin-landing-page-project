# odin-landing-page-project
Landing page exercise from The Odin Project

This is my attempt at completing this exercise and my version of it. All of this is done completely by me based on the knowledge I picked up following "The Odin Project" course so far. I did not look at any of the other solutions posted by other students before completing my version.

I went for "minimalistic" look based on the original example from the Odin exercise. The finished page follows the criteria given and only has minor adjustments added by me.
